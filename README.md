🎧 Akash Sound – DJ Business Website

This is a custom-built website created to promote a local DJ business run by my father, named after me — Akash Sound. The goal was to build a clean, easy-to-navigate, mobile-friendly website that helps potential clients explore past events, learn more about available services, and book directly through a built-in contact form.
